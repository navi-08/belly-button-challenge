Belly Button Biodiversity 
 
 the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

This code is a part of a web application that uses D3.js and Plotly to create an interactive dashboard for exploring the "Bellybutton Biodiversity" dataset. Let's break down the key components and functionality:

1. **Data Fetching:**
   - The code starts by defining the URL (`url`) from which the JSON data will be fetched.
   - It uses D3.js to fetch the JSON data and logs it to the console.

2. **Initialization Function (`init`):**
   - The `init` function is responsible for initializing the web page.
   - It populates a dropdown list (`selDataset`) with sample IDs retrieved from the dataset.
   - It then calls three functions (`makeBar`, `makeBubble`, and `makeDemographics`) to generate charts and demographic information for the first sample.

3. **Bar Chart Generation Function (`makeBar`):**
   - This function generates a horizontal bar chart using Plotly.
   - It filters the sample data based on the selected sample ID, extracts the necessary data (sample values, OTU IDs, and labels), and creates a bar chart trace.
   - The trace is then used to create a Plotly bar chart, which is displayed in the HTML element with the ID "bar."

4. **Bubble Chart Generation Function (`makeBubble`):**
   - Similar to `makeBar`, this function generates a bubble chart using Plotly.
   - It filters the sample data, extracts relevant data, and creates a bubble chart trace.
   - The trace is used to create a Plotly bubble chart, which is displayed in the HTML element with the ID "bubble."

5. **Demographic Information Display Function (`makeDemographics`):**
   - This function populates the demographic information panel.
   - It filters the metadata based on the selected sample ID and displays the key-value pairs in the HTML element with the ID "sample-metadata."

6. **Dropdown Change Event Function 
   - This function is called whenever the dropdown selection changes.
   - It logs the selected value and calls the three functions (`makeBar`, `makeBubble`, and `makeDemographics`) to update the charts and demographic information based on the selected sample.

7. **Initial Execution (`init`):**
   - The `init` function is called initially to set up the web page with charts and demographic information for the first sample.

In summary, this code initializes a dashboard with charts and demographic information for the "Bellybutton Biodiversity" dataset. Users can interact with the page by selecting different samples from the dropdown, and the charts and demographic information will dynamically update based on the selected sample.
